# ImdbMovieSortingScript
This python script enable the user to sort their movies according to Imdb rating. This script has certain restriction and some manual effort need to be put to make this work.  The specified movie folder should contain movies directly ie movies should not be inside another folder. it may be possible that some of the movies didn't get sorted because of couple of reason. Like Fast and Furious 7 was not getting sorted because on Imdb database the name of the movie is Furious Seven.
Improvements are welcome
